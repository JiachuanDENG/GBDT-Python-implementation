    "In GBDT, we are trying to construct a ensemble algorithm with multiple \"weak algorithms\". Let $F(X_i) = f_1(X_i) + ... + f_m(X_i)$, we are constructing a ensemble algorithm F(X_i) with the sum of weak algorithms $\\{f_n(X_i)\\}_{n=1,2,...}$, in GBDT, $f_n$ are choosen to be shallow decision trees.\n",

    "When $Loss = \\sum_i L(y_i,F(X_i))$, we want to minimize the Loss, however, we can not directly do gradient descent on parameters of $F(X_i)$, since it is consist of multiple decision trees, and the parameters of decision trees are just ```split_feature_index``` and ```split_threshold```, which we can not get their conresponding gradient. But since $F_{m}(X_i) = F_{m-1}(X_i)+f_m(X_i)$, we can consider the whole $F$ as a parameter, and Loss is only related to one Variable -- $F$, so we only need to do gradient descent of $Loss(F)$ on F:\n",

    "We can use a normal function g(x) to help us understand this step better. If we want to get smaller g(x), we can update x as $x_t = x_{t-1}+\\alpha\\cdot(-\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x_{t-1}})$. Similarily, For each sample $X_i$, we want to update  $F_{m}(X_i) = F_{m-1}(X_i)-\\alpha_i\\cdot\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial F_{m-1}(X_i)}$, where we can consider $residual_i = -\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial F_{m-1}(X_i)}$ as the \"direction\" to update F.\n",

So far, we only know how to get the \"direction\", and use $residual_i$ to fit a regression decision tree to simulate the \"direction\". But how about the \"step size\"?
